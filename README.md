- The app is build completely in Swift 4

# Code Details
- I've used MVP pattern for this project, I know its fairly simple App and probably MVC will do
but I needed to show some structure in the code, also MVP allowed me to separate some logic into the presenter
instead of having a huge viewcontrollers.
- Also, Using MVVM or VIPER, ...etc would be an overkill for this App

- Unit tests also was just a showcase and with the time restriction I wanted to show as much examples on testing as I could.
